TMX Syncer
==========
It is nice to use same tilesets in different .tmx files, but things
get annoying when you update properties of some maps and you should
copy the same change to all the other maps too.

The idea of this tool is to help synchronize multiple .tmx files. It
is still in early developement stage, so only few of the things work
